# Sampling on Imbalanced Dataset
Credit card fraud detection data is an imbalanced data set with binary classification.


We have two techniques to make it balanced - Oversampling and undersampling. Here we used Oversampling

Before:

Sampling techniques (Simple random sampling, Systematic sampling,Stratified sampling,Cluster sampling,Normal train test splitting ) on 6 classification models using Grid Search(Bernoulli,Decision,Kneighbors,logistic,Random,SVC). Sample size formulas were used to decide sample size.  . 
Testing on the remaining data set.

Final output
